# FreeChatGPT by Kathool
FreePyChatGPT is a basic Python-based script that runs in the console, it communicates with a free-to-use API Endpoint provided by [BetterChatGPT](http://bettergpt.chat/), their GitHub repository can be found [here](https://github.com/ztjhz/BetterChatGPT).
# API
This script is nothing without the data and AI models of the used API. Thanks to people like [Ayaka14732](https://github.com/ayaka14732), ChatGPT can be free to use in any form. Developers like [me](https://github.com/kathool) can use it in code like in this repo you're reading about right now, as well as consumers who want to use [BetterChatGPT](http://bettergpt.chat/) instead of the [OpenAI website](https://chat.openai.com/).
If for whatever reason the originally used API endpoint in this code becomes deprecated or unavailable, you may [host your own](https://github.com/ayaka14732/ChatGPTAPIFree#host-your-own-instance) which requires an OpenAI API Key or use [ChatGPTAIFree](https://github.com/ayaka14732/ChatGPTAPIFree)'s public API endpoint which you can find in the code or right here:
```
https://chatgpt-api.shn.hk/v1/
```
I highly encourage you to check out the GitHub repo pages of [ChatGPTAIFree](https://github.com/ayaka14732/ChatGPTAPIFree) and [BetterChatGPT](https://github.com/ztjhz/BetterChatGPT) to get more info on the API being used in this script to become more knowledgable on what you're interacting with if you choose to use this script.
This is all Open-Source for a reason and if you are concerned about things like **Privacy** or how this is **Free** it all can be found on the [ChatGPTAIFree GitHub Repository](https://github.com/ayaka14732/ChatGPTAPIFree).
